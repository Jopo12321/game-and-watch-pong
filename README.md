# Pong game for game and watch

My first homebrew game for Nintendo game and watch.

This is the second new version of the game.
I added many features.
 - The player is greeted with the main menu instead of the game.
 - The player can choose difficulty and the color of paddle and ball.
 - There is a in-game menu.
 - Added demo when the main menu is idle.
 - Many more....
